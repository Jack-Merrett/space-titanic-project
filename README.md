# Space Titanic Project

## Description

The "Space Titanic" project is a data analysis and machine learning project that aims to analyze the data from the fictional space cruise ship "Space Titanic" and build a predictive model to determine the likelihood of survival for passengers in case of any space accidents.

## Dataset

The dataset for the "Space Titanic" project contains information about the passengers on board the space cruise ship. It includes features such as age, gender, ticket class, cabin, and whether the passenger survived or not. The data is stored in a CSV file named "space_titanic_data.csv".

## Goals

### The main goals of the "Space Titanic" project are:

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct a thorough exploration of the dataset to understand the distribution of features, identify patterns, and correlations.

    Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data by handling missing values, feature engineering, and converting categorical variables to numerical.

    Visualization: Create visualizations to gain insights into the data and present findings effectively.

    Machine Learning: Build a machine learning model to predict the survival status of passengers based on available features.

    Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the machine learning model using appropriate metrics and fine-tune the model for better results.

## Technologies Used

The project will be implemented using the following technologies:

    Python: For data analysis, data preprocessing, and machine learning tasks.
    Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
    NumPy: For numerical computations.
    Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.
    Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating the machine learning model.

## Getting Started

To get started with the "Space Titanic" project, follow these steps:

    Download the dataset from Kaggle. You can find the dataset at link-to-dataset.

    Clone the project repository to your local machine.

    Install the required dependencies listed in the "requirements.txt" file using pip install -r requirements.txt.

    Explore the dataset and notebooks in the "notebooks" directory to understand the data and perform EDA.

    Run the "data_preprocessing.py" script in the "src" directory to clean and preprocess the data.

    Build and train the machine learning model using the "machine_learning_model.py" script in the "src" directory.

    Evaluate the model's performance and make necessary improvements.
